## Problem Statement

Insurance claim processing is traditionally time-consuming, error-prone, and data-heavy. Manual validation of policy terms, medical records, and historical claims increases operational burden and delays settlements. ClaimTrackr solves this through intelligent automation using AI, GenAI, and machine learning.
